  <br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak" target="_blank" title="Steve Wozniak wikipedia">Steve Wozniak</a> is American electronics engineer, programmer, philanthropist, and technology entrepreneur.</strong> In 1976, <u>he co-founded Apple Inc.</u> with partner and co-founder Steve Jobs, which later became the world's largest information technology company by revenue and the largest company in the world by market capitalization.<p style="margin-top:20px;"> Through their work at Apple in the 1970s and 1980s, he and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs are widely recognized as two prominent pioneers of the personal computer revolution.

    Early life

  <br><br>
  Steve Wozniak was born and raised in San Jose, California, the son of Margaret Louise Wozniak (née Kern) (1923–2014)[15] from Washington state[1](p18) and Francis Jacob "Jerry" Wozniak (1925–1994) from Michigan.[1](p18) His father, Jerry Wozniak, was an engineer for Lockheed Corporation.[9](p1) He graduated from Homestead High School in 1968, in Cupertino, California.
  <br><br>
  The name on Wozniak's birth certificate is "Stephan Gary Wozniak", but his mother said that she intended it to be spelled "Stephen," which is what he uses.[1](p18) Wozniak has mentioned his surname being Ukrainian[16][17] and has spoken of his Ukrainian and Polish descent.[1](pp129–130)[16]
  <br><br>
  In the early 1970s, Wozniak's blue box design earned him the nickname "Berkeley Blue" in the phreaking community.[2][18]
  <br><br>
  Wozniak has credited watching Star Trek and attending Star Trek conventions while in his youth as a source of inspiration for his starting Apple Computer, Inc.[19]
  Career
  <br><br>
  In 1969, Wozniak returned to the San Francisco Bay Area after being expelled from the University of Colorado Boulder in his first year for hacking the university's computer system and sending prank messages on it.[20][21] He re-enrolled at De Anza College in Cupertino before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1971.[9](p1) In June 1971, as a self-taught project, Wozniak designed and built his first computer with his friend Bill Fernandez.[9](p1) Predating useful microprocessors, screens, and keyboards, and using a punch card and only 20 TTL chips donated by an acquaintance, they named it "Cream Soda" after their favorite beverage. A newspaper reporter stepped on the power supply cable and blew up the computer, but it served Wozniak as "a good prelude to my thinking 5 years later with the Apple I and Apple II computers".[22] Before focusing his attention on Apple, he was employed at Hewlett-Packard (HP), where he designed calculators.[23] It was during this time that he dropped out of UC Berkeley and befriended Steve Jobs.[4][24]
  <br><br>
  Wozniak was introduced to Jobs by Fernandez, who attended Homestead High School with Jobs in 1971. Jobs and Wozniak became friends when Jobs worked for the summer at HP, where Wozniak, too, was employed, working on a mainframe computer.[25]
  <br><br>
      "We first met in 1971 during my college years, while he was in high school. A friend said, 'you should meet Steve Jobs because he likes electronics, and he also plays pranks.' So he introduced us."

  <br><br>
  Their first business partnership began later that year when Wozniak read an article titled “Secrets of the Little Blue Box” from the October 1971 issue of Esquire, and started to build his own “blue boxes” that enabled one to make long-distance phone calls at no cost.[26][27] Jobs, who handled the sales of the blue boxes, managed to sell some two hundred of them for $150 each, and split the profit with Wozniak.[28][29] Jobs later told his biographer that if it hadn't been for Wozniak's blue boxes, "there wouldn't have been an Apple."[30]
  <br><br>
  In 1973, Jobs was working for arcade game company Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California.[31] He was assigned to create a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout. According to Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, Atari offered $100 (equivalent to $576 in 2019) for each chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Wozniak reduced the number of chips by 50, by using RAM for the brick representation. Too complex to be fully comprehended at the time, the fact that this prototype also had no scoring or coin mechanisms meant Woz's prototype could not be used. Jobs was paid the full bonus regardless. Jobs told Wozniak that Atari gave them only $700 and that Wozniak's share was thus $350 (equivalent to $2,016 in 2019).[32][1](pp147–148, 180) Wozniak did not learn about the actual $5,000 bonus (equivalent to $28,797 in 2019) until ten years later. While dismayed, he said that if Jobs had told him about it and had said he needed the money, Wozniak would have given it to him.[33](pp104–107)
  <br><br>
  In 1975, Wozniak began designing and developing the computer that would eventually make him famous, the Apple I.[34] On June 29 of that year, he tested his first working prototype, displaying a few letters and running sample programs. It was the first time in history that a character displayed on a TV screen was generated by a home computer.[1] With the Apple I, Wozniak was largely working to impress other members of the Palo Alto-based Homebrew Computer Club,[35](pp35–38) a local group of electronics hobbyists interested in computing. The club was one of several key centers which established the home hobbyist era, essentially creating the microcomputer industry over the next few decades. Unlike other custom Homebrew designs, the Apple had an easy-to-achieve video capability that drew a crowd when it was unveiled.[36]
